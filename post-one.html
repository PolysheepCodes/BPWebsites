<h3>Hello Peeps And Geeks welcome to my Blog todays topic: Ready Player One: a mirror to a different world usually when you think about books you think of books you can read to enjoy or books you can read to relive history or sometimes to escape reality but let me introduce an eye opener for you Mirror or window books you can read these to look into a different characters point of view or to take a look at what you think of yourself and i want to talk to you today about my mirror book Ready Player One its a book about an 18 year old girl in a post apocalyptic world and her only escape is the oasis the biggest online game in the world when the creator dies and a contest is started and they go on a 20 year long journey to find the easter egg and end the game now the reason i feel this is my mirror book is due to the main character they're an adventurous spirit in a world with all odds against them a gamer in a world of prically cactusâ€™s she was the only one who could help her family when all hope was lost for her and her family even if there was some casualties in the end she came through in the end which is why i believe its a mirror book for me a story of war sadness and topped off with a happy ending most people wouldnt even bother to read a book that long or that sad but hey we are a special bit of people alright i hope to see you again my Peeps and Geeks please tune in next week for my blog</h3>
